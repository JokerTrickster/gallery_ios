# PRD: Gallery Cloud Sync

## Executive Summary

Gallery Cloud Sync is an iOS gallery application that provides unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos through AWS S3 integration. Users can manually select and upload media to the cloud, download them back to their device, and organize content using albums and folders. The app features advanced search capabilities including date-based, album-based, AI object recognition, and location-based search, offering a superior alternative to iOS's limited local storage.

**Key Value Proposition:** Unlimited cloud storage eliminating device storage constraints while maintaining full local copies of user's media library.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
iOS users face severe limitations with device storage capacity, forcing them to constantly delete photos and videos or purchase expensive iCloud storage upgrades. Existing solutions either lock users into Apple's ecosystem or provide poor user experiences with clunky interfaces.

### Why is this important now?
- Modern smartphones capture high-resolution photos (12-48MP) and 4K videos consuming massive storage
- Users are increasingly frustrated with "Storage Almost Full" notifications
- Cloud storage costs have decreased significantly, making unlimited storage feasible
- Users want control over what gets stored in the cloud rather than automatic syncing of everything

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona: Mobile-First Photo Enthusiast
**Demographics:** Age 20-45, smartphone as primary camera, takes 50-200 photos/month
**Pain Points:**
- Constantly running out of device storage
- Forced to delete precious memories
- Doesn't trust automatic cloud sync
- Wants granular control over cloud uploads

### User Journeys

#### Journey 1: First-Time User Onboarding
1. User downloads and opens the app
2. User signs in/registers (backend authentication)
3. User is prompted to grant Photos library access
4. User sees empty gallery (existing photos are ignored)
5. User begins taking new photos with iOS Camera app
6. New photos appear in Gallery Cloud Sync app
7. User selects photos to upload to cloud

#### Journey 2: Manual Upload Workflow
1. User opens the app
2. User browses their photo library (organized by albums/folders)
3. User selects multiple photos/videos
4. User taps "Upload to Cloud" button
5. Upload only proceeds when connected to WiFi
6. Progress indicator shows upload status
7. On failure, system retries up to 3 times
8. User receives notification when upload completes

#### Journey 3: Search and Discovery
1. User wants to find specific photos
2. User uses search bar with multiple filters:
   - Date: "December 2024"
   - Album: "Vacation Photos"
   - AI Object: "dog", "food", "sunset"
   - Location: "Seoul", "Busan"
3. Results display matching photos instantly
4. User can refine search with combined filters

#### Journey 4: Download from Cloud
1. User accesses cloud-stored photos
2. User selects photos to download
3. Photos download and save to device
4. Both local and cloud copies exist simultaneously

2. AWS S3 bucket is provisioned and accessible
3. Users have consistent WiFi access for uploads
4. Photos contain EXIF metadata for date/location search
5. AI object recognition model is available (CoreML or cloud-based)

- ❌ Face ID/Touch ID app lock
- ❌ Hidden albums
- ❌ Cellular data upload option
- ❌ Battery optimization during upload
- ❌ Offline mode support
- ❌ Video playback editing or trimming
- ❌ RAW photo format support
- ❌ Live Photos support

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Backend API delays | High | High | Parallel dev with mock server, clear API contract |
| S3 storage costs spiral | Medium | High | Usage monitoring, potential tier limits in future |
| AI search accuracy poor | Medium | Medium | Start with basic ML model, iterate with user feedback |
| iOS background upload limits | High | Medium | Educate users to keep app open, optimize task duration |
| Photo library permission denial | Low | High | Clear onboarding explanation of value proposition |

## Open Questions

1. How will users be notified when uploads complete in background?
2. Should we support iCloud Photo Library integration or only local device photos?
3. What happens if user deletes photo from device but it exists in cloud?
4. How do we handle duplicate photos (same image uploaded twice)?
5. Should we compress photos/videos before upload to save bandwidth and storage?

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this PRD
2. Backend team to finalize API specification
3. Design team to create UI mockups
4. Break down into development epics and stories
5. Run: `/pm:prd-parse gallery-cloud-sync` to create implementation epic
